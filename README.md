# RiverRunner-Arduino-code
The RiverRunner is a low cost prototype to measure in situ dissolved CH4 and CO2. The main components are an Arduino mini, a reral time clock with EEPROM memory, a micro SD card module and a voltage regulator. To measure CH4 we use a TGS2611-C Sensor (Figaro, Japan) and to measure CO2 a miniature NDIR senosr (Senseair, Sweden).
